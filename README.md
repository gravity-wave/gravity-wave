Test tool for header tags

What is Gravity Wave?

Before we get to that first we have to provide an update on the latest advancements in physics. Gravitational waves are incredibly hard to detect but originate from a huge events in the universe. Read more on how we just detected them.

“They’re waves, like light or any other kind of electromagnetic radiation, except here what’s ‘waving’ is space and time itself,” NASA astrophysicist Ira Thorpe

So what does that have to do with you? Well an ultra light weight version of header tag wrapper tech just dropped too.

Project Goals

Wrap don’t mediate: Pass all the bids directly into the ad server TYVM. This leaves the idea of guaranteed buys and ad server priority untouched, as it should be. This also allows for bid encryption which should be standardized on.
GPT monkey patch protection layer: No bidder should be able to override or wrap GPT calls to gain an advantage
Primary AJAX timeout system: No bidder should be allowed to sit in the network stack longer than their allotted timeout window to free up resources
Require direct bidder participation: Inclusion of bidder implementation code within the official repository must be done by a engineer from the
Measure and enforce all aspects of latency: In browser queuing and network request level latency all contribute to page load performance issues.
